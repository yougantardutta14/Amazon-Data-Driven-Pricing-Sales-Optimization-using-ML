This project presents an end-to-end data-driven framework for dynamic pricing in e-commerce by integrating high-accuracy machine learning models with causal inference to optimize discount strategies and maximize revenue. Using the Amazon UK Products Dataset 2023, the study performs extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and lag-aware temporal modeling to forecast monthly sales through XGBoost (R² = 0.962) and Random Forest (R² = 0.963), ensuring robust predictive performance. To move beyond correlation, Double Machine Learning (DML) is applied to estimate the true causal impact of discounts, revealing that blanket discounting is inefficient, with an Average Treatment Effect of –2331 units and only 42.7% of products benefiting from discounts. Treatment effect heterogeneity analysis segments products by responsiveness, identifying a “Very High Response” tier where targeted discounting generates substantial uplift. A policy simulation demonstrates that selectively discounting the top 25% responsive products yields an estimated 19.8 million unit sales increase and a projected 1.95 billion net revenue gain while preventing significant losses from non-responsive segments. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and deployment-ready, supporting monthly retraining, SKU-level recommendation export, and integration into pricing dashboards, thereby enabling precision discounting and sustainable revenue optimization in competitive e-commerce environments.
